# Cybersecurity Projects 
*by Nigora Jumaeva*

This repository contains beginner-friendly **cybersecurity and secure coding projects** created during my studies in **Computer Programming and Analysis at Seneca Polytechnic**.  
They demonstrate practical skills in **authentication, database security, encryption, and networking**, and serve as portfolio projects to showcase my programming and IT security learning.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Secure Login System (C++)
- Command-line program to register/login users.
- Demonstrates password salting + hashing (educational demo only).
- **How to run:**
  ```bash
  cd Secure-Login-System-Cpp
  g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -o secure_login main.cpp
  ./secure_login
  ```

### 2. SQL Injection Prevention Demo (Python + SQLite)
- Compares **unsafe string concatenation** vs **safe parameterized queries**.
- **How to run:**
  ```bash
  cd SQL-Injection-Demo
  python demo.py
  ```

### 3. Data Encryption Tool (Python)
- Implements Caesar Cipher (toy) and AES-based Fernet encryption (real-world).
- **How to run:**
  ```bash
  cd Data-Encryption-Tool
  pip install cryptography   # if not installed
  python encryption.py
  ```

### 4.Network Port Scanner (Python)
- Scans common ports (21, 22, 80, 443) on localhost or a given host.
- **How to run:**
  ```bash
  cd Network-Port-Scanner
  python portscanner.py
  ```

## Skills Demonstrated
- Secure coding practices (password handling, input validation)
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- Cryptography basics (symmetric encryption)
- Network security fundamentals (port scanning)
- Tools/Languages: **C++, Python, SQL, Git/GitHub, VS Code**

---

## Notes
- These are **educational demo projects** and **not production-ready security tools**.
- No sensitive data is stored in this repository (`users.txt` is gitignored).
- Created as part of my learning journey to strengthen both **programming** and **cybersecurity fundamentals**.
